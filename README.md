# CollegeCSExercises

This repository includes basic exercises based off of the in-class assignments of my Computer Science classes. We do these assignments at the end of a class period, then outside of class I continue working on them, adding to them as best I can for practice.

Since these are still basic CS classes (Comp 1010 and Comp 1020), the exercises are fairly simple, but should hopefully still work well for anyone in such early classes or at a similar level. As well, it should give a general idea of the sort of work we do in the Computer Science transfer degree pathway.

Exercises are sorted by what the exercise works with (specific function or construct we talk about in class), and consist of multiple parts, meant to vary in difficulty and show different uses / implementations of the function or construct.
